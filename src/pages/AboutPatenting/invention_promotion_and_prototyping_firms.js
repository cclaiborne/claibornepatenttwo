        paragraph1 = "Most inventors are eager to bring their inventions to market.  Many seek to find a company that will manufacture and market their invention, paying the inventor a handsome royalty for the privilege.  A number of inventors employ the services of an invention promotion or prototyping firm to market their invention to potential manufacturers.  Unfortunately, many invention and prototyping firms mislead naive inventors, charging large fees and delivering little of value."
        paragraph2 = "These two brochures, one from the Federal Trade Commission and one from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, contain valuable information for any inventor considering using an invention promotion or prototyping firm.  We urge our clients to read these materials closely before employing any such firm."
