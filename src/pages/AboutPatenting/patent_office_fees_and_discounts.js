        paragraph2 = "A small entity is entitled to a 50% reduction in most Patent Office fees. The specific definition of small entity is set forth in 37 C.F.R ยง 1.29, but generally means either a single individual inventor, a business with 500 or fewer employees, or a non-profit organization."
        paragraph3 = "A micro entity is entitled to a 75% reduction in most Patent Office fees. A micro entity must qualify as a small entity; must not have been named in more than four previously filed U.S. patent applications; must have a gross income not exceeding the U.S. Patent Office limitations on income; and must not be under obligation to assign to an entity with income exceeding the Patent Office limitations on income."
        paragraph4 = "Any entity that does not qualify as a small entity or a micro entity is treated as a large entity and must pay applicable Patent Office fees with no discount."
